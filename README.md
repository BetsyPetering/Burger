# Burger Logger
Using MySQL, Node, Express, Handlebars and a homemade ORM, this app keeps track of burgers and whether they hae been devoured or not. This project used the MVC design pattern; it uses Node and MySQL to query and route data in the app, and Handlebars to generate the HTML. This app has been deployed through Heroku.
